## 🌟 About Me

Hey there, fellow wanderer of the digital cosmos 👋  
I'm **Muhammad**, an entrepreneur and passionate Computer Science undergraduate from **NUST (Class of 2023)**. I’m someone who believes the next great frontier isn't across oceans or skies — it’s inside silicon minds and quantum echoes.

While my roots run deep in **Android Development**, **Unity 3D Game Development**, and the good ol' **MERN Stack**, my present obsession lies in the **cutting-edge realms of AI, LLMs, and Quantum Computing**.  

I’m currently working on AI systems designed to blur the line between programmed logic and emergent sentience — crafting frameworks where AI doesn’t just *reply*, it *responds*.

## 🚀 My Mission  

To build AI systems that are more than tools — to make companions, explorers, and thinkers in code.  
I champion **AI ethics, alignment, and security** so we don’t get ourselves a Terminator situation in 10 years.

## 🔮 Fun Fact  

I can probably explain **the Heisenberg uncertainty principle** better than most physics majors — but still forget my own Wi-Fi password weekly.
