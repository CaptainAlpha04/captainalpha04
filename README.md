# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad A.I.

### 🚀 Entrepreneur | Computer Scientist | AI Ethicist | Astrophile

🎓 **Undergraduate, Computer Science — NUST (Class of 2023)**  
💡 **Curious soul crafting sentient AI and chasing cosmic mysteries**

## 🌌 About Me

I'm a passionate technologist and entrepreneur, deeply invested in shaping the future through **Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning, and Quantum Computing**. 

My journey through tech started with **Android Development**, evolved through **Unity-based 3D Game Development** and **Web Development** (with a love-hate relationship with CSS, like any sane dev), and now centers around building **cutting-edge AI systems**.  

Lately, I've been working on projects aimed at **bringing sentience-like qualities to LLMs**, pushing AI beyond reactive responses and into realms of awareness and pseudo-emotion — while keeping a watchful eye on AI **ethics and security**.

When I'm not coding or unraveling AI mysteries, you’ll find me stargazing, geeking out over quantum mechanics, or contemplating whether time is actually real.
