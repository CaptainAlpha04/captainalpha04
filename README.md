## 🌟 About Me  

Hey 👋 I'm **Ali**, a curious soul blending code with cosmos.  
Currently **President at NUST Entrepreneurs Club** and **Founder of Spark Chapter** — a non-profit empowering students to shatter glass ceilings.

👨‍💻 From Android apps to 3D games, MERN stacks to sentient AI models, I’ve dived headfirst into all kinds of code. Now I’m obsessed with **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, **AI ethics**, and **quantum weirdness**.  

Big fan of open-source, people-powered learning, and meaningful conversations. If it’s unconventional, I’m already interested.
